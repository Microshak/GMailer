<p>Hi,</p>

    <p>Seattle GiveCamp is back the weekend of October 17th, and we’d love your support!</p>

    <p>For 14 years, Seattle GiveCamp has brought together volunteer developers, designers, and project managers for a weekend-long “code-a-thon for charity.” In that time we’ve built 149 projects for local nonprofits and contributed over 667,520 volunteer hours to organizations that make our community stronger.</p>

    <p>We don’t have paid staff or paid volunteers — everything is donated. One of our biggest needs each year is simply feeding our volunteers, so they can focus on building real solutions for nonprofits. This is where you can help.</p>

    <p>We’re asking for sponsorships or donations of any amount to help make this weekend possible. In the past, companies like Starbucks, Best Buy, Chef, and Gravity have supported Seattle GiveCamp — and we’d love to add you to that list.</p>

    <p>Sponsors will be recognized on our social media, and if we can afford t-shirts this year, we’ll include logos there as well.</p>

    <p>If you’d like to sponsor, simply reply to this email and we’ll coordinate. You can also learn more at <a href="https://seattlegivecamp.org/">seattlegivecamp.org</a>.</p>

    <p>Thank you for considering being part of the Seattle GiveCamp story — your support directly fuels the work our volunteers do for nonprofits in our community.</p>

    <p>Warmly,<br>
    Mike Roshak<br>
    Seattle GiveCamp Organizer</p>
